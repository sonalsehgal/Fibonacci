# Fibonacci
Fibonacci
🚀 Features
- Accepts user input for the number of terms
- Prints the Fibonacci sequence starting from 0
- Uses a loop-based approach for sequence generation

🧠 How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence they want.
- Initializes the first two terms: 0 and 1.
- Iteratively calculates and prints each term using:
next = a + b
a = b
b = next
- Displays the sequence in the console.
🛠 Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Terminal or IDE that supports Java execution

📥 How to Run
- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Compile the program:
javac day6/Fibonacci.java
- Run the program:
java day6.Fibonacci

📝 Notes
- The sequence starts from 0 and includes the number of terms specified by the user.
- You can enhance this program by:
- Adding input validation
- Formatting the output as a single line
- Supporting recursive or memoized versions
